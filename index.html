    <h1>Hello, I'm Kafayat Abdulwahab</h1>

    <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Have you ever wished for a Product Manager who doesn't just manage backlogs but crafts solutions that bridge user needs
        with business strategy? That’s the kind of value I bring to every team I join.
    </p>
    <p>
        At AIMA Solutions, I led the development of an AI-powered CV writing service after identifying a key gap in the job application journey. 
        From ideation to launch, I collaborated closely with design and engineering, defined user stories, and delivered a product that significantly boosted customer engagement. 
        It wasn’t just a project, it was a mission to empower job seekers with the tools they need to succeed.

        My journey spans industries and cross-functional teams, from refining agile processes and accelerating delivery at Prunedge to contributing to data-driven tools like a credit assessment product at Periculum. 
        Across all these experiences, I’ve built a reputation for clear communication, thoughtful product decisions, and a relentless focus on user outcomes.
